# Screenshot Face Blur Chrome Extension
A small Google Chrome Extension which takes screenshot of a full webpage and detects faces from the page, blurs it and shows it in a new window as a image.
Face detection train method is not so strong, so can't make very good assumption. Will try to improve in future.
